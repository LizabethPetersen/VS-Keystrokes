This app combines a learning tool with a game that introduces you to the keystroke shortcuts inherent in the source code editor, VSCode. Learning these keystrokes aids efficiency and increases proficiency for working in this powerful tool.

Learn
On the next screen, you will be presented with flashcards showing various keyboard commands that serve as shortcuts for different actions. For practice and creating "muscle memory", type the command shown and you will be presented with information about the shortcut on the flipside of the card. 

Play
When you are ready to Play, you will be shown a .gif of an action being performed in VS code. Your job is to enter the keyboard command that completes that action. You're playing for points, so choose wisely!
